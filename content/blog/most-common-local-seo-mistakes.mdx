## Inconsistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone Number) Information

### The Mistake:

Your business’s **NAP details** appear differently across online directories, websites, and social media. Search engines rely on consistency to verify your legitimacy—if your information is inconsistent, your rankings suffer.

### How to Fix It:

1. Ensure your business details are exactly the same on **Google Business Profile, Yelp, Facebook, and local directories**.

2. Use a citation management tool like **Moz Local, BrightLocal, or [Whitespark](https://whitespark.ca/?via=calin)** to audit and correct inconsistencies.

3. Update your website’s contact page with the **correct details**.

## Not Optimizing Google Business Profile (GBP)

### The Mistake:

Many businesses claim their GBP listing but fail to fully optimize it. Missing details, outdated hours, or no photos reduce engagement and lower your chances of appearing in local search results.

### How to Fix It:

1. Fill out **all GBP sections**, including business hours, categories, and services.

2. Upload **high-quality images** showcasing your location, team, and products.

3. Regularly monitor and respond to **customer reviews**. Engage with professional feedback and address negative comments.

## Ignoring Customer Reviews

### The Mistake:

Businesses that fail to collect or respond to customer reviews miss out on a huge **ranking factor** in [local SEO](/blog/what-is-local-seo). A lack of reviews—or only negative ones—can push potential customers to competitors.

### How to Fix It:

1. Encourage satisfied customers to leave **Google reviews**. Offer incentives or discounts for feedback.

2. Respond to all reviews&mdash;**thank positive reviewers** and address negative feedback professionally.

3. Monitor review sites like **Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Facebook** for feedback.

## Poor Website Optimization for Local Search

### The Mistake:

Even with strong local citations, your website might not rank well if it lacks **local SEO signals** like location-based keywords, structured data, and **[mobile optimization](https://webscript.ro/en)**.

### How to Fix It:

1. Use **geo-modified keywords** (e.g., `“best coffee shop in Miami”`) in your title tags, meta descriptions, and headings.

2. Create location-specific **landing pages** if you serve multiple areas.

3. Optimize your site for **mobile devices** and voice search to attract local customers.

## Not Having a Mobile-Friendly Website

### The Mistake:

Most local searches happen on **mobile devices**, yet many local businesses still have websites that are slow, unresponsive, or hard to navigate on smartphones.

### How to Fix It:

1. Use a **responsive design** that adapts to different screen sizes.

2. Optimize for **fast loading speeds** (`compress images, enable caching, and use a CDN`).

3. Ensure that buttons, text, and forms are **easy to use** on mobile devices.
